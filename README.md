# data-analytics-journey
This repository documents my transition into data analytics and business intelligence.

Current focus:
- SQL (PostgreSQL)
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Data visualization (Power BI)
- Business reporting and analytics

Projects and weekly practice work will be published here as I build technical proficiency and applied experience.
